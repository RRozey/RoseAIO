# RoseAIO

RoseAIO is my own Hanbot scripting project. 

As of right now, the included champions in the public version are very limited.
I will be working on the rest in my free time so please be patient. 

## Current Features

The public version of RoseAIO Currently supports:

```bash
Champion Scripts:
Ashe
Lucian

Champion Add-Ons:
Xerath (Extra drawings to use with Gagong Xerath)
```

## Installation

You can install RoseAIO by going to the 'Market' Tab in the Hanbot3 Loader and clicking the install icon next to RoseAIO.
